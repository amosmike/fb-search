# Checkpoint 1
• Tabular data seemed to be clean so only checks were done - will come back to this to confirm.

• Image data has been resized and re-'moded' original images had modes of ['RGB', 'RGBA', 'L', 'P']. Each image has been '.convert'ed to RGB. 

• cleaned images then saved in 'clean_images' directory.
